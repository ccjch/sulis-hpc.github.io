## Other users

Other users with allocations of time on Sulis will be provided with a means to request support when their allocation becomes active.

# Research Software Engineering support

Users within the HPC Midlands+ consortium are able to request support from a Research Software Engineer (RSE) within their Call for Applications submission. Research Software Engineers are skilled individuals with experience to help with the following non-exhaustive list:

* Profiling of code to understand performance and recommend areas of improvement
* Developing code to add new functionality, improve scaling, add parallelism, or improve software maintainability
* Optimise code for performance on Sulis
* Wring the best performance out of code with complier flag choices
* Advise on matters of best practise regarding development workflows and version control.

Please request RSE support at the time of your application, or afterwards via your Support Contact.
