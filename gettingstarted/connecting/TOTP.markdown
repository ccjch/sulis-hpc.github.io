## What are Time-based One-Time Passwords

Time-based One-Time Passwords or TOTP is an algorithm utilising the current time to generate a one time password. [TOTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-based_One-Time_Password) is a common method for adding a second factor of authentication to user accounts.

## TOTP Clients

Sulis has mandatory two-factor authentication so you will need a mobile app or desktop program installed on your computer or mobile phone before you login for the [first time](./firsttime.html). Below we have listed some applications which are compatible with the TOTP algorithm although we do not endorse any particular client and please show due caution when installing any application.

## Resetting TOTP

If you still have login access to your account (i.e. you just want to change your TOTP or you've used an single use emergency code to login) then you can reset your TOTP by running:

```
{{site.data.terminal.prompt}} 2fa-reset
```

at the command prompt.

If you can no longer login to your account on Sulis, you will need to contact your [local support team](../../support/) and ask for your TOTP to be reset.
